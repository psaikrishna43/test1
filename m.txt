TestNG is an open source automated testing framework; where NG means Next Generation. TestNG is similar to JUnit (especially JUnit 4), but it is not a JUnit extension. It is inspired by Junit and NUnit (Junit equivalent in C#). TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests like unit, functional, and integration.

 

Major features of TestNG from Selenium perspective are:

Annotations makes the methods easier to differentiate

Grouping and prioritization of tests can be done to control execution flow of test cases   

Data can be Parameterized using different built in annotations

Parallel execution of test methods is possible
